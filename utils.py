HOW_THIS_WORKS = """``` 1) Open Telegram
2) Search for TxTKM
3) Begin by clicking on 'Start' at the bottom of your screen.
4) The chat will ask you for personal details which won't be revealed unless you want it to.
5) By using function '/skip' you can choose to not input the personal details.
6) Next up a bar shows that'd let you choose your hobbies and interests so the the system can match you with people with similar interests.
7) Once this is over, type in the function /chat.
8) Three options come up in front of you
    - random chat
    - questionnaire
    - alter interests
9) click on random chat and the bot will match you with a random person from TKM.
10) The questionnaire option will let you create multiple Yes/No questions that you could sent to the person you've been matched with.
11) The alter interest option will let you change your interest you've entered earlier. ```"""
